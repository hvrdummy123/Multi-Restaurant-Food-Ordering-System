Traditional food ordering systems often face scalability, performance bottlenecks, and single-point failures due to a monolithic architecture. As order volumes increase, systems become slower, harder to maintain, and more prone to failures.
Moreover, integrating multiple restaurants, payment gateways, and delivery management into a single platform leads to complex dependencies, delays, and inefficiencies.

Thus, there is a need for a microservices-based food ordering system that:
- Scales efficiently as order demand grows.
- Improves fault tolerance, ensuring a single service failure doesn’t crash the entire system.
- Enhances performance, with optimized restaurant listing, order processing, and delivery tracking.
- Simplifies system maintenance by enabling independent updates and deployments.

The Multi-Restaurant Food Ordering System is a scalable, efficient, and modular platform that allows users to browse multiple restaurants, place food orders, make payments, and track deliveries. 
The system follows a Microservices Architecture, where each core functionality—such as user management, restaurant services, order processing, and delivery tracking—is handled by an independent service.
This architecture ensures high availability, scalability, and better fault isolation while enabling teams to develop, deploy, and maintain different components independently.
